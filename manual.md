## Understanding the Three Values and Six-Level Scoring

This tool assesses your workplace "vibe" across three core values. Each value is scored on a six-level scale, where every level represents a different but equally valid expression—not a judgment of good or bad.

### How to Read Your Scores

- **Each value (Focus, Values, Social) is scored from 1 to 6.**
- **No score is inherently better or worse.**  
  Each end of the scale simply represents a different workplace style or emphasis.
- **Your profile is a unique combination of these expressions.**  
  Use your results to reflect on what makes your team or culture distinctive—and what feels right for your goals.

### Value 1: Focus

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1     | Flexible and responsive. The environment adapts easily to change and thrives on spontaneity. |
| 2     | Open and exploratory. There’s a sense of curiosity and willingness to try new directions. |
| 3     | Balanced approach. Structure exists, but there’s room for creativity and adjustment. |
| 4     | Purpose-driven. Clear goals guide most work, with some flexibility for innovation. |
| 5     | Highly organized. Projects are structured, expectations are clear, and deadlines matter. |
| 6     | Intensely focused. Every action is aligned with mission or targets; progress is measured and tracked closely. |

### Value 2: Values

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1     | Pragmatic and adaptable. Decisions are made based on what works in the moment. |
| 2     | Situational. Principles are valued, but flexibility is key to getting things done. |
| 3     | Balanced. There is respect for both practical outcomes and guiding principles. |
| 4     | Ideals-informed. Clear values influence actions, but adaptability is still present. |
| 5     | Strongly principled. Shared values are central to decisions and team identity. |
| 6     | Mission-centric. The organization’s core beliefs are evident in every action and interaction. |

### Value 3: Social

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1     | Independent. Work is often solo; individuals are trusted to manage themselves. |
| 2     | Private. Collaboration happens when necessary, but personal space is respected. |
| 3     | Balanced. There’s a healthy mix of independent work and collaboration. |
| 4     | Cooperative. Teamwork is encouraged, and sharing ideas is common. |
| 5     | Highly collaborative. The environment is open, communicative, and team-driven. |
| 6     | Deeply connected. Relationships and group identity are central; feedback and support flow freely. |

#### Interpreting Results

- **There is no “perfect” score.**  
  High or low on any value simply reflects your workplace’s natural style.
- **Use your profile for reflection.**  
  Think about which expressions of each value suit your goals, team, or project best.
- **Consider sharing and discussing your profile.**  
  Open dialogue about these styles can strengthen understanding and teamwork.
