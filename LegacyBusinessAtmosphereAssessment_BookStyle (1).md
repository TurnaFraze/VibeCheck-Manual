# Chapter 1: Introduction to the Legacy Business Atmosphere Assessment

Welcome to the Legacy Business Atmosphere Assessment—an interactive web-based tool designed to help organizations, teams, and employees evaluate the “vibe” and core values of their workplace. This chapter will guide you through the structure, purpose, and inner workings of the application, mirroring the clear, analytical style of the Legacy System 3.0 documentation.

## 1.1 Purpose and Philosophy

The Legacy Business Atmosphere Assessment is designed for anyone seeking to understand and visualize the true environment of a business or team. By translating subjective perceptions into data and scores, the tool empowers individuals and organizations to:

- Identify strengths and areas for growth in workplace culture.
- Visualize how teams align with foundational principles like Purpose, Adaptation, Connection, and more.
- Celebrate what makes their work environment unique, or discover opportunities for meaningful change.

# Chapter 2: The Structure of the Assessment

## 2.1 The User Experience

Upon visiting the main Assessment page, users are greeted with a clean, centered interface. Here’s the experience step-by-step:

1. **Business Identification:**  
   Users enter the business or team name and ZIP code, ensuring results are tied to a specific workplace context.
2. **Principle-Based Questionnaire:**  
   The user answers a series of carefully crafted questions, each corresponding to one of six core “Legacy Principles”:
   - **Power & Purpose (PP):** Clarity of goals, influence, ambition.
   - **Wisdom & Adaptation (WA):** Open-mindedness, flexibility, reflection.
   - **Connection & Impact (CI):** Empathy, social bonds, positive influence.
   - **Action & Method (AM):** Deliberation, efficiency, impulsiveness.
   - **Growth & Balance (GB):** Focus on progress, stability, well-being.
   - **Truth & Identity (TI):** Authenticity, honesty, self-awareness.

3. **Rating System:**  
   Each question is multiple-choice, with options ranked from 1–6, reflecting a spectrum from foundational to aspirational behaviors.

## 2.2 Visual and Technical Design

- **Responsive, Accessible UI:** The site uses a modern, mobile-friendly design with clear fonts, accessible contrast, and easy navigation.
- **Dynamic Questionnaire Rendering:** Questions are generated from a structured JavaScript array, so the survey can be easily expanded or edited by modifying the code.
- **Form Validation:** Required fields (business name, ZIP code, and all questions) prevent incomplete submissions. ZIP codes are restricted to 5-digit entries.

# Chapter 3: Scoring and Interpretation

## 3.1 Principle Scoring

Each response is mapped to a numeric score per principle. The total for each principle is calculated by summing the responses to its associated questions. For example:

```
scores = { PP: 0, WA: 0, CI: 0, AM: 0, GB: 0, TI: 0 };
```
Each question adds to its respective principle’s score, painting a multi-dimensional picture of the business atmosphere.

## 3.2 Paired Principle Analysis

After calculating each principle’s score, three “paired scores” are derived by combining related principles:

- **Focus:** PP + AM (Power & Purpose + Action & Method)
- **Values:** CI + TI (Connection & Impact + Truth & Identity)
- **Social:** WA + GB (Wisdom & Adaptation + Growth & Balance)

The highest-value pair is identified as the organization’s “dominant vibe.”

# Chapter 4: Results Page & Data Visualization

## 4.1 Results Display Overview

After submitting the assessment, the user is redirected to a results page. The top center of this page features a prominent square image area dedicated to graphically representing the business's results.

### Graph Visualization System

- **Base Graph:**  
  The graph background is a static PNG image, serving as the canvas for the visual representation of results.
- **Dynamic Overlay System:**  
  The assessment produces scores for three paired values: Focus, Values, and Social. For each value, a set of 6 transparent PNG overlays is available, representing different scoring levels (1–6).
- **Composite Visualization:**  
  The results page combines the base PNG with one overlay for each of the three values (a total of three overlays out of a possible 18), dynamically selected based on the assessment results.
- **Total Image Layers:**  
  - 1 static base PNG
  - 3 transparent overlays (one per value, selected from 6 possible per value: Focus, Values, Social)

This approach enables a visually engaging, instantly understandable display of the workplace’s dominant characteristics.

## 4.2 How Overlay Selection Works

For each paired value (Focus, Values, Social):

1. The assessment determines the score for that value (in the range 1–6).
2. The corresponding transparent PNG is chosen for that score.
3. Each overlay is layered in the correct position above the base graph to illustrate the level of each paired value.
4. The result is a composite visual uniquely reflecting the business’s strengths and tendencies.

# Chapter 5: Technical Implementation

## 5.1 Questionnaire Generation

The questions and options are stored in a JavaScript array of objects, each with a reference to its principle, text, and answer options. The UI is dynamically generated, which allows for:

- Easy editing or expansion of questions
- Consistent structure and styling

## 5.2 Score Calculation

When the form is submitted:

1. All responses are collected.
2. Scores for each principle are summed.
3. Paired scores are calculated.
4. The “dominant” paired dimension is identified.
5. The user is redirected to the results page with all data passed as URL parameters.

## 5.3 Results Page: Image Logic

- The results page parses the scores from the URL parameters.
- For each paired value (Focus, Values, Social), it determines the appropriate PNG overlay based on the score (1–6).
- The HTML/CSS/JS stack layers the overlays in the correct z-order on top of the static base graph.
- Only three overlays (one per value) are shown, ensuring clarity and focus.

## 5.4 Validation and User Guidance

- ZIP code input is sanitized to allow only digits and enforce a maximum length of five.
- All fields must be completed before submission.

---

# Chapter 6: Extending and Customizing

Because the assessment is driven by structured data and client-side logic, it is highly extensible:

- **To add new questions:** Insert additional objects in the `legacyQuestions` array.
- **To adjust scoring or add new principles:** Update the calculation and UI accordingly.
- **To enhance results:** Update the results page to interpret the new data and to add more visual overlays or change the graph display logic.

# Conclusion

The Legacy Business Atmosphere Assessment is a flexible, data-driven tool for capturing the true “vibe” of a workplace. With its powerful questionnaire, meaningful scoring, and unique graphical results system, it empowers organizations to see their strengths and growth areas at a glance—and to celebrate or improve what truly matters.
